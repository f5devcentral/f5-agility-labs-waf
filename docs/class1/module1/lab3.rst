   .. NOTE:: ASM behaves differently than LTM regarding changes. When
      editing BIG-IP LTM Configurations in the Configuration Utility (Web
      UI) changes are saved and applied immediately. In BIG-IP ASM,
      changes **must be saved first** and then at the time of the
      Administrator's choosing, they can be Applied (or activated) to
      BIG-IP ASM. This can be viewed as a "Deferred Commit" behavior. ASM
      allows for rollbacks of configuration.
