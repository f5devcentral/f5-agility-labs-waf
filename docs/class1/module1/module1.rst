-  Create a security policy using manual policy building

-  Enable application security logging profile

-  Validate that both the policy and logging profile are working

-  Review the auto-detection of web server capabilities (i.e. Apache,
   jQuery, etc)

-  Estimated time for completion: **30 minutes**

   This lab will demonstrate how to create and build a security policy
   using manual policy building.

   Before we begin, ensure that you have three virtual servers:

   - ``hackazon.f5demo.com_https_vs``
   - ``hackazon.f5demo.com_http_vs``
   - ``ip_rep_target_https_vs``

   You will be working primarily with ``hackazon.f5demo.com_https_vs``.
