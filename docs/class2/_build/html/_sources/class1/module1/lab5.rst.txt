Appendix A: Cyber Security – A Legal Perspective
================================================

Cybercrime Security:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Collective processes and mechanisms by which people, sensitive and
valuable information, products and services are protected from damage,
publication, tampering or collapse by unauthorized activities or
untrustworthy individuals and unplanned events respectively. Computer
security aims at the protection of persons, information and property
from theft, misuse, corruption, tampering, unauthorized disclosure, or
natural disaster, while allowing the information and property to remain
accessible and productive to its intended users

Background:
~~~~~~~~~~~

-  In the early 1980s law enforcement agencies faced the dawn of the
   computer age with growing concern about the lack of criminal laws
   available to fight emerging computer crimes.

-  In response, Congress included in the Comprehensive Crime Control Act
   (CCCA) of 1984 provisions to address the unauthorized access and use
   of computers and computer networks

-  Throughout 1985, both the House and the Senate held hearings on
   potential computer crime bills, continuing the efforts begun the year
   before. These hearings culminated in the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
   (CFAA)

 Current Legal Environment:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The Primary guide in most federal hacking cases in still the Computer
       Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA - passed by U.S. Congress in 1986)

-  Other federal statutes used for prosecuting Cybercrime are:

-  Wiretap Act

-  Unlawful Access to Stored Communications Act

-  Identity Theft and Aggravated Identity Theft Act

-  Access Device Fraud Act

-  CAN-SPAM Act

-  Wire Fraud

-  Communication Interference Act

Other considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition, most every state has its own Computer Crime Statutes. Each
state also has its own prosecutorial system. Some states are much more
active in the area of cybersecurity enforcement than others, but
typically the states will cooperate with federal authorities. Some state
laws are more restrictive than federal, i.e. in areas such as State Laws
Addressing “Phishing” and State Spyware Laws. The laws are a complex
web. Only skilled lawyers are capable of figuring out the full meaning
revealed in case law interpretations of the state and federal laws.

Legal vs. Illegal hacking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cracker vs Hacker

-  A hacker is a person intensely interested in the arcane and recondite
   workings of any computer operating system. Hackers are most often
   programmers. As such, hackers obtain advanced knowledge of operating
   systems and programming languages. They might discover holes within
   systems and the reasons for such holes. Hackers constantly seek
   further knowledge, freely share what they have discovered, and never
   intentionally damage data.

-  A cracker is one who breaks into or otherwise violates the system
   integrity of remote machines with malicious intent. Having gained
   unauthorized access, crackers destroy vital data, deny legitimate
   users service, or cause problems for their targets. Crackers can
   easily be identified because their actions are malicious.

Clear Dividing Line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Congress needs to enact a clearer, more technologically current law
   to rationally and fairly divide the line between legal and illegal
   hacking. The complete rewrite should include different Acts for
   criminal and civil rules and enforcement, and should tie into privacy
   and security legislation.

-  Need a clearer / more dependable way to distinguish between “ethical”
   and “malicious” hacking

-  Malicious hacking is always negative and destructive. Ethical
   hacking’s goal is to contribute to the security community and to
   improve overall security

White / Grey / Black(cracker) Hat Hacking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  All of them exploit weaknesses in computer systems and networks

-  Black Hat Hackers, computer criminals whose malicious activities
   serve their own ends ranging from financial gain to simply causing
   chaos

-  White Hat (“ethical”) Hackers are usually those that carry out their
   craft with no apparent criminal intention in mind

-  Grey Hat Hackers sit in the middle, often hacking into a system just
   to prove they can, but afterwards usually notifying the vendor or
   owner of the weakness

White Hat Hacking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Usually hired by companies to carry out vulnerability assessments and
   penetration testing, a technique that helps to determine how secure
   the company’s systems are.

-  It’s a necessary business service that allows businesses identify
   their weaknesses and shore up their defences against real criminals
   (Crackers / Black Hats)

Is Ethical Hacking Legal? – It depends!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Companies believe that authorizing an ethical hacker to test a
   company’s defences is enough legal protection to justify ethical
   hacking. Ethical Hackers believe they are justified by the fact that
   they are acting in the best interests of the company who hired them

-  However, what needs to be considered is how far the hacker is willing
   to go to test the systems. Or worse, to switch into grey hat mode,
   determined to break in just to prove they can

Ethical hacking pitfalls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Often, Ethical Hackers break laws in order to conduct their
   activities:

-  Obtaining a user’s PII (i.e. social engineering)

-  Gain access to the system using someone else’s credentials (obtained
   Illicitly)

-  Gain access to confidential information

-  Gain access to customer/employee information

-  Probe / “White Hat”-hack other avenues to the company being tested
   i.e. access via their business partners. Unless the business partner
   has been included in the scope of the penetration test, the ethical
   hacker has strayed outside the boundaries of the law to achieve their
   aims

Remarks
~~~~~~~

-  “Ethical Hackers” aim to test businesses’ security in a constructive
   way in order to improve it

-  Companies hire ethical hackers because they need to test their
   security. By granting their permission to the pentest, they
   effectively cover their corporate eyes and ears while these actions
   are carried out

-  However, often neither the company or the hacker know if/what laws
   are being broken

-  So it is a Grey Area – Ethical Hackers are not granted immunity –
   they need to ensure that the actions they take do not break the laws
   outlined in the Law Acts and Statuses

Worlwide View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  No single international framework for cybersecurity law, but some
   multi‐lateral efforts

-  Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (2001)

-  Council of Europe’s effort to harmonize disparate national cybercrime
   laws

-  EU Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive

-  PRIVACY – Proposed EU General Data Protection Regulation

-  New law would apply to any company that controls or processes the
   personal data of Europeans through the offering of goods and services
   – even if company has no physical presence in Europe.

-  Fines of up to 4% of company’s annual global revenue or €20 million
   for violations

-  Other countries each have Cybersecurity laws

Tensions in Global Cyberspace
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The rapid growth of the Internet and sophistication of cybercrime
   continues to outpace the ability of the legal

-  system to respond. The attribution problem makes policing and
   accountability particularly difficult.

-  Cyber assets are distributed between the public sector and private
   sector, and the private sector is comprised of a

-  wide range of disparate entities.

-  There is a lack of international coordination on cyber issues. As a
   result, there is no centralized international cyber

-  threat information sharing or common computer incident response
   teams.

-  Different values among countries; different levels of preparedness;
   different degrees of interest and risks.

-  Companies and governments face overlapping and conflicting sets of
   laws:

-  Harmonization vs. divergence of regional and national laws

-  Personal data laws and system/infrastructure obligations are not
   integrated or reconciled

-  Quality of company's cybersecurity depends in part on visibility into
   traffic on its own network, but such insight can

-  be in tension with cultural and sometimes legal barriers to
   electronic monitoring of employees.

-  Approach to implementation: market‐driven vs. regulatory

-  Governance: government‐centric vs. multi‐stakeholder

Certified Ethical Hacking Certification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Certified Ethical Hacker is a skilled professional who understands and
knows how to look for weaknesses and vulnerabilities in target systems
and uses the same knowledge and tools as a malicious hacker, but in a
lawful and legitimate manner to assess the security posture of a target
system(s). The CEH credential certifies individuals in the specific
network security discipline of Ethical Hacking from a vendor-neutral
perspective.

The purpose of the CEH credential is to:

-  Establish and govern minimum standards for credentialing professional
   information security specialists in ethical hacking measures.

-  Inform the public that credentialed individuals meet or exceed the
   minimum standards.

-  Reinforce ethical hacking as a unique and self-regulating profession.
