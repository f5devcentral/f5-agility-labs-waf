Ensure that you’ve allowed the command to run for at least 10 minutes
(more time will yield more interesting graphs), before starting this
section.

Goto **Security > Reporting > Application > Charts** and click “Top
attacks in last hour” from the dropdown in the upper left corner of the
graph.

Notice that you can wave the cursor over different parts of the graph to
get a breakdown of the events in a given time period.

Now go to “\ **Top Attackers for Alarmed Requests**\ ” and set the time
period to “\ **Last Hour**\ ”:

Explore some of the other charts. If no data is displayed check that the
time period is set to “\ **Last Hour**\ ”.

Now go to **Security > Overview > Application > Traffic** and set
“\ **Override Time range**\ ” to **Last Hour**

This page is fully customizable so take some time to add, remove, and
re-arrange some of the widgets to see what’s possible.

This concludes **Lab 4.**
