Exercise 4.0: HTTPS iApp with Policy
----------------------------------------

Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

F5 offers a number of templated installations for various applications.  For generic web based applications you can find the https iapp template.  As an update to this template we have added security functions such as firewall and web application firewall policies that can be deployed with the application.  In this lab we will focus on using the basic http iApp template.  If you are interested in integrating similar templates in to your automation and orchestration strategies please follow this training with the Application Services Lab located here:
