This lab will show you how to configure protection against webscraping activity using a Firefox loop macro.

Connect to the lab environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. From the jumphost, launch chrome, click the BIG-IP bookmark and login to TMUI. admin/password

#. From the jumphost, launch firefox, which we will use to create the macro.

#. On the BIG-IP TMUI, Go to Local Traffic > Virtual Servers > asm_vs

#. Click the Security > Policies tab at the top

#. Change the Application Security Policy to “Disabled”

#. The Logging Profile should be set to “Log Illegal Requests” and click update


Connect to the Webgoat Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Using Firefox, click on the shortcut for WEBGOAT login

   ``http://10.1.10.145/WebGoat/login``

Create a security policy to prevent webscraping

#. Name the policy “webscraping”

#. Select “Rapid Deployment Policy” for the "Policy Template", this will bring up a prompt asking if you want to continue, click "Ok"

#. Select “asm_vs” for Virtual Server and click Create Policy (upper left)

#. Change Enforcement Mode to “Blocking”

Create a DNS Resolver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: A DNS Resolver (allows the Bigip to do DNS lookups) is required for effective anomaly detection

|

#. You can either follow the link in the warning as you enable Web Scraping, or go to Network > DNS Resolvers > DNS Resolver List and Create

#. Assign a name to the Resolver profile and click Finished


Attempt to scrape the Webgoat Login Page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Go back to your Webgoat tab in Firefox and re-run the macro you created

#. Did the page hits load successfully?


Review the Security Event Logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Go to Security > Event Logs > Application > Requests

3. What caused ASM to block the request?

5. Do you see any events?


Reset the Virtual Server config for the next lab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Clear the app security event log by going to Secuirty > Application Security -> Event Logs > Requests and clicking the check box to select all "Illegal Requests". Then click "Delete Requests".
