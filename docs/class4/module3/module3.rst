Metasploit Utilities
=======================================

Update Metasploit application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to stay current, you need to update your copy of the Metasploit
regularly. Issue the following command from the Kali bash command shell:

root@kali# sudo apt-get update

Note on non-Kali installs of Metasploit, you can issue the command
*msfupdate* within the Metasploit console but this is disabled in recent
releases of Kali in favor of using the apt-get command.

Update the Exploit database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This process is a little more involved. First you need to locate the
exploits you want to download (or even write your own!). The best
database for this is at https://www.exploit-db.com/ for viewing the
exploits but you can use the git tool grab specific items. The github
repository is located at
https://github.com/offensive-security/exploit-database

There is also a tool available on the git repository called searchsploit
which will search the database for you and list the exploits for you.

To find a new Windows exploit, you can execute from the Kali server:

On the Kali bash shell:

git clone https://github.com/offensive-security/exploit-database.git
/opt/exploit-database

cd /opt/exploit-database

Say you want to find the exploit which works with the recent NSA Hacks
released in May/June 2017, known as ‘eternalblue’ for SMB hacking:

./searchsploit eternalblue Windows

{ a list of exploits will be returned }

Now you can choose which one you want to load, we will load the one for
Windows 7/2008 or the file 42031.py. Looking at the output of the
command, you will see that the files are in the
platforms/win\_x86-64/remote directory. This file is the Ruby on Rails
code that will be executed by Metasploit, and it will need to be copied
to the proper folder.

cd ~/.msf4/modules

ls –ls

If the ‘exploits’ directory doesn’t exist, create it:

mkdir ~/.msf4/modules/exploits

cd exploits

Do the same for the directory tree: win\_86-64 and remote so you have
the following directory structure:

/root/.msf4/modules/exploits/win\_x86-64/remote

Now copy the Ruby files from the source location

cp /opt/exploit-database/platforms/win\_x86-64/remote/42031.py .

Now open Metasploit

msfconsole

And search for the newly added exploit

search eternalblue

And the exploit will be displayed and is available for use.

Capture The Flag:
--------------------

It’s time for a game of Capture the flag where you will test your skills
at both running and patching exploits. The “Capture the Flag” server and
scoreboard is located at https://ctf.f5lab.biz. Please first visit the
site to create a team name and have a look around. To complete a
challenge, enter in the Flag you receive when successfully running or
patching an exploit.

Hack and Patch
--------------

Note that each Mission is prefaced with [Hack] or [Patch].

Hacking
~~~~~~~

For the [Hack] missions, you will be attempting to run some sort of
exploit. Some will require knowledge of programming or some serious
Google-foo to make work. You MUST do these first in order to understand
how the [Hack] works. Also, you need to run the [Hack] missions against
the “Unprotected” VIPs.

Patching
~~~~~~~~

For the [Patch] missions, you need to rerun the same Hack you did in the
corresponding mission but against the “Protected” VIP which has a
special ASM policy attached.

\*\*\*\*\* Do not create your own ASM Policies \*\*\*\*\*

The policies which are attached have been customized to integrate with
our CTF API to show you the flags. Each “Protected” VIP has an existing
ASM Policy attached to it, please ensure that you modify the proper
policy for the VIP when you are attempting to get the patch flag.

Your First Hack and Patch
-------------------------

We will do the first one together… you’ll see how this works and we’re
sure you will enjoy the rest of the class.

Useful tools
------------

In order to complete the Capture the Flag, you will need some tools to
view the requests/responses and to complete the Hack missions. Many of
the tools you will need have been loaded onto the VMs you have access
to. Some of them are explained below:

SQLmap
~~~~~~

**SQLmap** is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the
process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over
of database servers. It comes with a powerful detection engine, many
niche features for the ultimate penetration tester and a broad range of
switches lasting from database fingerprinting, over data fetching from
the database, to accessing the underlying file system and executing
commands on the operating system via out-of-band connections. Here is a
link to the sqlmap documentation: `Sqlmap
Website <http://sqlmap.org/>`__

SQLmap is installed on the Kali Linux server.

Burp Suite
~~~~~~~~~~

**Burp Suite** let’s you review/edit the data send and received among
other things. It functions as a proxy, typically configured to listen on
127.0.01 loopback address. An application such as a web broswer or
sqlmap is configured to use Burpsuite as a Proxy. This enables the
review/editing of what is transmitted and received. Here is a link to
Burpsuite downloads and documentation
`BurpSuite <https://portswigger.net/burp/>`__.

Burpsuite is installed on the Windows 7 Jumpbox.

Outwit Image Scraper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Outwit is a simple, straight-to-the-point online image browser. Explore
the Web for pictures and easily create, save, and share collections.
With OutWit Images, you can automatically explore Web pages or search
engine results for pictures and create, save and share your collections
or view them as full-screen slideshows.

Outwit is installed on the Windows 7 Jumpbox.

Edit This Cookie
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EditThisCookie is a Google Chrome extension which allows the user to
easily see and manipulate the cookies on the current page.

EditThisCookie is installed on the Windows 7 Jumpbox.

Completing the CTF
------------------

You can complete the CTF Contest without referring to the document here,
however some of the challenges require some extra tools and some
specific knowledge in how to use those tools. We have added this to the
document here for you, allowing you to conduct the challenge by
following the examples here. If you wish, you can do the challenges
without these steps.

Challenge: Remote Command Execution
-----------------------------------

Level 1
~~~~~~~

Command injection is an attack in which the goal is execution of
arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable
application. Command injection attacks are possible when an application
passes unsafe user supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc.) to
a system shell. In this attack, the attacker-supplied operating system
commands are usually executed with the privileges of the vulnerable
application. Command injection attacks are possible largely due to
insufficient input validation.

In this example, we have an application which uses a vulnerable version
of the Struts2 library. This library has a vulnerability in the file
upload component, allowing a properly formatted exploit to execute
commands on the server. More can be learned about this vulnerability
here:
https://devcentral.f5.com/articles/apache-struts-remote-code-execution-vulnerability-cve-2017-5638-25617

Using the supplied exploit read the *flag.txt* file in the Tomcat7
folder.

Level 2
~~~~~~~

When there is a php application on a web server, typically credentials
are stored within the application config in clear-text. Using this
knowledge, the Struts2 vulnerability and the DVWA site, access the
database for DVWA and get the flag from the database.

Challenge: Domain Cookie Exploit
--------------------------------

One of the uses of Cookies is to track sessions and identify users. For
example, once a user authenticates to a server, the server places a
cookie on the user computer that identifies the user. The next time the
user accesses the site, they will not be asked to authenticate – the
server will check the cookie that identifies the user as authenticated,
and allow the user in.

Cookie Hijacking is one of the attacks that can be executed to gain
access to privileged information. In this exploit, an attacker would
gain access to a cookie that contains user credential information,
session information, or other types of information that identify a user
to a system. Then the attacker would use this cookie (i.e. copy it to
their computer) to gain access to the server.

F5LAB.BIZ is a company that offers financial services to customers. They
have two services: hr.f5lab.biz (human resources services) and
accounts.f5lab.biz (tax services). Both services use a common backend
database to authenticate users.

Challenge: Webscraping
----------------------

Webscraping is a popular technique used by both white and black hatters
to “scrape” a website to harvest information from it. A good example of
a mischievous webscraping activity would be a competitor scraping a
website in order to harvest a product catalog or product prices. Once
they obtain this information, they can gain intelligence about their
competition and use it for their own ends.

There are a variety of tools out there to conduct webscraping. Some are
off-the shelf and some are custom-developed. In either case, these tools
are smart in that they know how to bypass the webscraping security
controls – by modifying their traffic patterns (i.e vary the request
rate and frequency to avoid detection)

Webstore.f5lab.biz is an online business that offers variety of
products. It was detected that an attacker has mounted a webscraping
attack against the website and is copying all the product images.

It was discovered that an attacker is using a popular scraping tool
OutWit Hub:

|image8|

The setup
~~~~~~~~~

Open OutWit Hub from the Start Menu

In the OutWit Hub GUI, go to **Tools/Preferences/Exports & Downloads**
and specify a windows folder under “Save files in”

This folder is where the hacker (web scraper) will save the scraped
images

**Select Images on the left-hand panel in the GUI:**

|image9|

Note: The OutWit application is written in Java so it sometimes has a
challenge with resizing on the RDP session. If you cannot see all the
panels well (as in the screenshot below), please resize it and move the
sections around in OutWit until it resembles what you see in the
screenshot below):

|image10|

The highlighted sections in the mage above show the settings that need
to be set in order to continue with the exercise.

Tell the scraping tool to look for a file called *flag-hacked.jpg*.
Finding this file will earn you a point:

|image11|

Change the scraping settings in the tool’s GUI to Auto-Catch and
Auto-Empty:

|image12|

Make sure you tell the tool to Save the images which it finds:

|image13|

train the tool on
`https://webstore.f5lab.biz <https://webstore.f5lab.biz/>`__:

|image14|

Hit enter

First set of images should show in the OutWit Hub GUI.

Important: Make the scraper scrape the entire site by following all the
site’s links. To do this, push the “Autoexplore the links on the page”
button:

Challenge: BlindSQL Injection
-----------------------------

Blind SQL (Structured Query Language) injection is a type of \ `SQL
Injection <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection>`__ attack that
asks the database true or false questions and determines the answer
based on the applications response. This attack is often used when the
web application is configured to show generic error messages, but has
not mitigated the code that is vulnerable to SQL injection.

When an attacker exploits SQL injection, sometimes the web application
displays error messages from the database complaining that the SQL
Query's syntax is incorrect. Blind SQL injection is nearly identical to
normal \ `SQL
Injection <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection>`__, the only
difference being the way the data is retrieved from the database. When
the database does not output data to the web page, an attacker is forced
to steal data by asking the database a series of true or false
questions. This makes exploiting the SQL Injection vulnerability more
difficult, but not impossible.

Putting it together: using SQLMAP with Burp. If dealing with clear-text
http, you can just configure sqlmap to proxy thru Burp. If the site you
are working with enforces SSL/TLS, within Burp: Proxy Options Proxy
Listeners Request handling, select “Force Use of SSL”

| To force SQLMAP to use burp as a proxy: ./sqlmap.py -u "http://<target
  URL" --proxy "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
| where -u is target URL, --data is POST data and --proxy is burp proxy
  details.

SQL injection/BlindSQLI exploit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Web applications front-end access to back-end databases. Properly built
applications will validate the input into form fields. A client will
fill out a web form and the results will be submitted. With SQL
injection exploits, SQL commands are submitted in via the web
application forms. If the application is not validating the input
(blocking actual SQL commands), then those will get submitted to the
database and results can be returned. When testing a website for SQL
injection vulnerabilities, errors may be returned from vulnerable
websites that indicate the site is vulnerable and how to exploit it.
Some websites may suppresses the error messages however. This makes SQL
injection harder and what leads to Blind SQL injection.

SQLi exploits can be performed manually thru a web browser. While this
can be useful to test a website, it can consume time to manually exploit
a vulnerable website. This is where SQLmap can be useful as an automated
method to make SQL injection easier. The SQLmap official website says:

    SQLmap is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the
    process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking
    over of database servers. It comes with a powerful detection engine,
    many niche features for the ultimate penetration tester and a broad
    range of switches lasting from database fingerprinting, over data
    fetching from the database, to accessing the underlying file system
    and executing commands on the operating system via out-of-band
    connections.

The focus of this lab will be on the use of SQLmap to "map" the
database, learning the databases, tables, rows and columns. Successful
completion of this lab will result in retrieval of the usernames and
passwords. In the database you will find the CTF token.

Proxying the requests thru Burp Suite will help to see and work thru the
exploit. Later in this lab you can use Burp Suite to proxy the SQLmap
requests to get a better view of what is actually being sent/received.

| Both Burp Suite and Sqlmap are tools installed on the jump box
  machine.
| Burp Suite is a link on the desktop and SQLmap is located in
  c:\\sqlmap (as python sqlmap.py)

Executing the exploit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connect to the jumpbox

Open Chrome and enable the developer tools (Control-Shift-I)

In order to use SQL map, you will need to gather a valid session cookie
and the URL to test. The Chrome developer tools can help with this.
Clicking on the Application tab of the developer tools will provide
details on the cookies as well as other information,

|image16|

Browse to the DVWA website via the bookmark

| Login to the DVWA website and click on the “SQL injection (Blind)”
  panel.
| (User:admin, pass:password)

Click the SQL Injection (Blind) on the left side of the page and enter a
number (4 for example) into the user id field and click submit.

With these details, we are able to construct the sqlmap command.

| Open a command prompt in windows and change to the “c:\\sqlmap”
  directory.
| This implementation of sqlmap uses python so you will use the
  “sqlmap.py” script

You can type “sqlmap.py –hh” for an extended list of the options.

Some of the options that will be of interest to us include:

| -u (for specifying the URL to test)
| --cookie (for specifcing the session cookie to use)
| --dbs (for enumerating the databases)
| -D <database name> (for specifying a database to work with)
| --tables (to provide a list of the tables in the DB)
| --columns (provides the DB columns)
| -dump (will dump the contents of the columns specified)
| --proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080 (to use a proxy, in this case Burp suite
  listening on the loopback address of the local machine)
