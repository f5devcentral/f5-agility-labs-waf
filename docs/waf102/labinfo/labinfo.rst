Lab Environment & Topology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. NOTE:: Some activity will be performed  work is done from the Linux Client, which can
   be accessed via RDP (Remote Desktop Client) or SSH. No installation or
   interaction with your local system is required.

Environment
-----------

**Windows Client:**

**Web Attack Tools used in this lab:**

- `curl <https://curl.haxx.se/>`_ - command line webclient. Very useful for debugging and request crafting
- `Postman <https://www.postman.com/>`_ - API Development and request crafting

**Linux server:**

- `JuiceShop <https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/>`_ - OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure web application! 

**Lab Topology**
-------------------

The network topology implemented for this lab is very simple. The following
components have been included in your lab environment:

-  1 x Ubuntu Linux 20.04 client
-  1 x F5 BIG-IP VE (v16.1.2) running Advanced WAF with IP Intelligence & Threat Campaign Subscription Services.  
-  1 x Ubuntu Linux 20.04 server

The following table lists VLANS, IP Addresses and Credentials for all
components. **The "password" will be provided by your instructor.**
