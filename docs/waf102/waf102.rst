WAF 102 - Getting started with WAF, Bot Detection and Threat Campaigns
=================================================================================

This class will focus on a best practice approach to getting started with F5 WAF and application security. This introductory class will give you guidance on deploying WAF services in a successive fashion. This 141 class focuses entirely on the negative security model aspects of WAF configuration. 

This is the 1st class in a two part lab series (102 and 201) based on: `Succeeding with Application Security <https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K07359270>`_ which closely maps to this visualization of layered Application Security.
