Lab 1 - Use the Secure Guided Configuration to Build a WAF Policy
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Objective
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Log into the BIG-IP

- Create a blocking policy using the guided configuration utiliy

- Apply the security policy to an existing virtual server

- Apply a security logging profile to the virtiual server

Create security policy using the Guided Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. On your UDF page, go to your BIG-IP component, click the **Access** drop down menu and choose **TMUI** (traffic management user interface).  This is a link to your configuration utility.  

    .. image:: ../images/bigiplogin.png

#. Login to the BIG-IP with the ever so secure credentails of Username  ``admin`` and Password ``f5demos4u!``.  

#. On the Main tab to your left, select **Security > Guided Configuration**. This opens the Guided Configuration screen.

#. Click on the **Web Application Protection** template button.

#. The guided configuration now provides an overview of what will be configured. Click the  **Next** button.

#. Give your configuration the name ``juice_shop_waf`` this will also name your security policy.

#. Under **Select Enforcement Mode** select **Blocking**

    .. Note:: Typically you would deploy a new policy in a transparent mode so you can observe the logs before blocking to help avoid false positives.  But come on....this is a lab.  We are going to block stuff!  

#. Click on **Show Advanced Settings** button in the upper right hand corner of your page.

    .. image:: ../images/advanced2.png

#. Under **Server Technologies** add the following to the selected window.  Adding these technologies will assist in building a more precise policy.

    - AngularJS
    - Express.js
    - JavaScript
    - JQuery
    - MongoDB
    - Node.js
    - SQLite

#. Press the **Save & Next** Button below.  

    .. image:: ../images/servertechnologies.png

    .. Note:: We are adding these technologies since we know what the application is using.  There is also a feature that can be turned on that can allow the policy to learn these technologies.

#. Check off **Assign Policy to Virtual Server**, under **Virtual Server** choose **Use Existing**, and move the Juice_Shop_VS to the selected window.  Press **Save & Next**

    .. image:: ../images/addvs.png

#. The next page will summarize the objects and policy configuration.  Review, and take note that you can also go back and edit if required.  When done click **Deploy** at the bottom of the screen.  It will take a few moments to complete the policy build.

    .. image:: ../images/ready_to_deploy.png

#.  After the policy is created, we will want to apply a logging profile to our new security policy.

    - Go to **Securirty -> Overview -> Summary**, and the policy you just created should be listed. 
    - Place a check to the left of the **Virtual Server** name that your new security policy is applied to.  
    - Now click the blue **Attach** button above and select **Logging Profile**

    .. image:: ../images/attachlogging1.png

    - Select **Log illegal requests** and press the other **Attach** button below.

    .. image:: ../images/attachlogging2.png

    - You will now see the logging profile is added under the Application Security column.  

#.  You now have an active application security policy that is learning, staging, and logging protections against the ``Juice_Shop`` virtual server.
