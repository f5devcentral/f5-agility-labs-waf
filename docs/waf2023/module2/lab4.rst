Lab 4 â€“ Advanced configuration using the OWASP Dashboard
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Objective
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Apply some final configurations to protect against the remaining OWASP Top 10

- Do a final review of the OWASP Compliance Dashboard

Apply additional protections against the OWASP Top 10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Navigate to **Security -> Application Security -> Security Policies** and select the Juice_Shop_WAF policy we created.
    
    - Select **Sessions and Logins** 
    
        .. image:: ../images/login_enforcement_16_1_2.png

    - In the Authenticated URLs field enter ``/#/privacy-security/`` and press the add button and ``/#/wallet`` and press the add button.  Based on app exploration we can identify that these URIs should only be accessible after successful login.
    - Press the **Save** button below.  Then press the **Apply Policy** Button in the top right corner. 
    - Now press the link in the note message below titled **Learning and Blocking Settings Screen**

        .. image:: ../images/enforcementURLs.png

    - On this screen add a checkmark in the **Alarm** and **Block** checkboxes.
    - Press **Save** below and **Apply Policy** in the top right.
    - These protections are now applied to A2, and also the Login Enforcement protections in A5.

#. Back on the OWASP Dashboard, path **Security -> Overview -> OWASP Compliance**. Click on the expand arrow next to **A4  XML External Entities**.  Previous signature protections already are helping to mitigate these other XML exploits.  Here are the steps to apply disallowing DTDs.  

    - Navigate to **Security -> Application Security -> Content Profiles -> XML Profiles**.
    - Click the name of the default XML profile. (Typically we create a new profile, and we do not modify a default profile, but for simplicity and since we only have one application we will do so here)
    - Under Profile Properties, click the XML Firewall Configuration tab.
    - On the Defense Configuration list, click Advanced.
    - Clear the Allow DTDs check box.
    - Click the **Update** button.
    - Go to **Security -> Application Security -> Policy Building -> Learning and Blocking Settings**.
    - Expand the **Content Profiles** section.  Place a check in the  **Alarm** and the **Block** settings next to **XML data does not comply with format settings**.  
    - Press **Save** at the bottom of the screen and **Apply Policy** in the top right corner.  
    - This is currently NOT resolving on on this specific build within the dashboard but you could put a checkmark on the No/Ghostbuster icon for this to get the A4 catagory to 100%.

#. Navigate to **Security -> Application Security -> Security Policies** and select the Juice_Shop_WAF policy we created.  We now need to block **Disallowed File Types**.  

    - Expand HTTP Message Protection and Select File Types.
    - Here you can view/edit the pre-configured allowed and disallowed file types.  You can just view, and no changes need to made here.
    - To apply these blocks now go to **Security -> Application Security -> Policy Building -> Learning and Blocking Settings**.
    -  Expand the **File Types** section.  Place a check in the **Alarm** and **Block** boxes for **Illegal file type**. 
    - Press **Save** at the bottom of the screen and **Apply Policy** in the top right corner.  
    - If you want to view the dashboard again you will see the A5 catagory is now at 100%.

#. On the OWASP Dashboard, path **Security -> Overview -> OWASP Compliance**. Click on the expand arrow next to **A7 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**.  If you remember, A1 Injection included the protections against a lot of signatures and one of those catagories was XSS.  We are not using any HttpOnly cookies in this app so the last requirement to earn us 100% needed is applying the blocking of **Disallowed Meta Characters in Parameters**.

    - To view/edit the pre-configured allowed and disallowed Meta Characters go to **Security -> Application Security -> Parameters -> Character Sets -> Parameter Value**.  No changes need to made here.
    - To apply these blocks now go to **Security -> Application Security -> Policy Building -> Learning and Blocking Settings**.
    -  Expand the **Parameters Section**.  Place a check in the **Alarm** and **Block** boxes for both **Illegal meta character in parameter name** and **Illegal meta character in value**

        .. image:: ../images/Illegalmetachar.png

    - Press **Save** at the bottom of the screen and **Apply Policy** in the top right corner.  
    - If you want to view the dshboard again you will see the A7 catagory is now at 100%.

Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~~

Now for our last step, once again go back to the OWASP Dashboard, path **Security -> Overview -> OWASP Compliance**.
You should now be 100% compliant in all categories.  While it is nice to see completion, the goal of the dashboard may not always be to immediately reach 100% in all categories.  The true value is providing visibility and measuring the security controls we are applying to our applications.
