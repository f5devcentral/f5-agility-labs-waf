Lab 2 â€“ Use the F5 WAF Tester Tool
----------------------------------

Objective
~~~~~~~~~

- Initialize the F5 WAF Tester Tool
- Use the F5 WAF Tester Tool 

Task - Initialize the F5 WAF Tester Tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Either SSH into the External Jump Server or use the Web Shell. If using the Web Shell change from the root user to the ubuntu user

``su - ubuntu``

Initialize the WAF Tester Tool by running the following command:

``f5-waf-tester --init``

The output from running the command above will look like the following:

::

   [BIG-IP] Host []: 10.1.1.4
   [BIG-IP] Username []: admin
   [BIG-IP] Password []:
   ASM Policy Name []: juice_shop_waf
   Virtual Server URL []: http://10.1.10.102
   Blocking Regular Expression Pattern [<br>Your support ID is: (?P<id>\d+)<br>]:
   Number OF Threads [25]:
   [Filters] Test IDs to include (Separated by ',') []:
   [Filters] Test Systems to include (Separated by ',') []:
   [Filters] Test Attack Types to include (Separated by ',') []:
   [Filters] Test IDs to exclude (Separated by ',') []:
   [Filters] Test Systems to exclude (Separated by ',') []:
   [Filters] Test Attack Types to exclude (Separated by ',') []:

Edit the configuration if required. It is much easier to edit the config file than re-running the --init if you made a mistake.

::

   vi ~/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/f5_waf_tester/config/config.json

Or if you prefer not to type all that out there is a bash alias:

``waf_config``

After initialization the configuration file should look like this:

::

   {
     "asm_policy_name": "juice_shop_waf",
     "big-ip": {
       "username": "admin",
       "host": "10.1.1.4",
       "password": "admin"
     },
     "blocking_regex": "<br>Your support ID is: (?P<id>\\d+)<br>",
     "threads": 25,
     "filters": {
       "exclude": {
         "attack_type": [],
         "id": [],
         "system": []
       },
       "include": {
         "attack_type": [],
         "id": [],
         "system": []
       }
     },
     "virtual_server_url": "http://10.1.10.102"
   }


Task - Use the F5 WAF Tester Tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the tool as follows: 

::

    f5-waf-tester -r f5_waf_tester_report_1.json

Or if you prefer not to type all that out there is a bash alias:

::

    waf_test

If many of the tests failed, the signatures may be out of date so ensure the latest signatures have been installed. The following article provides instructions on how to do that: https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K82512024

Quickly check how many tests passed and failed:

::

    grep true f5_waf_tester_report_1.json | wc -l
    grep false f5_waf_tester_report_1.json | wc -l

Or use the these bash aliaes to save you some typing:

::

    true_count
    false_count

View the results of the test:

::

    less f5_waf_tester_report_1.json

Continue to tune your WAF policy and check the OWASP Dashboard and then re-run the F5 WAF Tester.
