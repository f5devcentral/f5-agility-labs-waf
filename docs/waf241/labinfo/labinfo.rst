Lab Environment & Topology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. NOTE:: All work is done from the Linux Client, which can
   be accessed via RDP (Windows Remote Desktop). No installation or
   interaction with your local system is required.

Environment
-----------

**Linux Client:**

**Web Attack Tools used in this lab:**

- `BURP Community Edition <https://portswigger.net/burp/>`_ - Packet Crafting
- `curl <https://curl.haxx.se/>`_ - command line webclient. Very useful for debugging and request crafting
- `Postman <https://www.postman.com/>`_ - API Development and request crafting
- `ab (Apache Bench) <https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html>`_ - HTTP Load Testing

**Linux server:**

- `JuiceShop <https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/>`_ - OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure web application! 

**Lab Topology**
-------------------

The network topology implemented for this lab is very simple. The following
components have been included in your lab environment:

-  1 x Ubuntu Linux 20.04 client
-  1 x F5 BIG-IP VE (v16.1.2.2) running Advanced WAF with Ip Intelligence & Threat Campaigns Subscription Services.  
-  1 x Ubuntu Linux 20.04 server

The following table lists VLANS, IP Addresses and Credentials for all
components. **The "password" will be provided by your instructor.**
