WAF201 – Elevated WAF Security
=================================================================================

This class will focus on a best practice approach to elevating your WAF protection after becoming comfortable with the content in the 102 "Getting Started" class. 
This is the 2nd class in a three-part, guided lab series (WAF101, 102, and 201) based on: `Succeeding with Application Security <https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K07359270>`_ which closely maps to this visualization of layered Application Security.
