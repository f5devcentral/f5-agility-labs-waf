Access Policy Manager is acting as an OAuth client, so it logs token validations, along with
authorization failures. Mouse over the graph to see the different request metrics. If you donâ€™t
have enough dataset, go back to Postman, and send a few more requests, with and without the
JWT token. Come back to this report and click **Refresh** in the top right corner.

Yay! You have completed Lab 1.
